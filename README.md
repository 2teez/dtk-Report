# Daily Trunk Report

Daily Trunk Report `dtk` enables the user to generates NSS Trunk reports by dates using csv files.

This report needs two csv files namely:

	1. ne_5_Incoming_Calls_through_Trunk_Groups_.*.csv

	2. ne_5_Outgoing_Calls_through_Trunk_Groups_.*.csv

These files `must` be located in the directory named `datafiles`, which is also located in the
dtk-Report directory.

If the directory is not located or the csv file is *_NOT_* in this directory this program will not work.


## Usage:

There are three ways to launch this program:

[] Using `shell`

[] Using `perl`

[] Using `python3`
